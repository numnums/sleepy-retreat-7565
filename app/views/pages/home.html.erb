            <h4>Preschool kicks off a lifetime of learning, preparing children to read a blackboard and learn from across the room. Catching vision problems at this age through screening—before they become larger learning or behavioral issues—sets children up for educational and social success.</h4>

                We bring advanced, progressive vision screening to schools through our two successful onsite initiatives:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For private preschools, we bring high-tech, thorough vision screening and well-trained, professional screeners to school sites. We send children home with the results of their screenings that very same day, along with any recommendations on follow-up care, so parents can take confident action.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                For publicly funded low-income preschools, we offer Vision 360⁰: the same high-tech, thorough vision screening and well-trained screeners, plus follow-up eye exams with professional optometrists and prescription glasses through our Eye Bus.
                We are committed to making sure all of Northern California’s children can see well.
