            <h1>Every child needs their vision for a lifetime of successful learning</h1>
            <p>Preschool kicks off a lifetime of learning, preparing children to read and write through constant visual intake of new knowledge. Without clear vision, preschoolers can quickly fall behind their peers and, devastatingly, may even be misdiagnosed with developmental and behavioral issues as they struggle to learn.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Catching vision problems at this age—before they become larger learning inhibitors—sets children up for success in school and in life.</p>
