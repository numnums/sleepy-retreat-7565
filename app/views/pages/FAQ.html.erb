          <strong>What information do schools receive for their records?</strong>
          <br/><br/>
          Before the screening, schools will receive a list of all children whose parents have preregistered for the screening. After the screening, schools will also receive a list of all children screened and their results for their records.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <strong>What if parents want to pay by cash?</strong>
          <br/><br/>
          Unfortunately we are unable to process cash payments but our registration system is accessible via any smart phone or computer.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          <strong>What if parents want siblings to be screened?</strong>
          <br/><br/>
          Unfortunately we are not able to accommodate siblings who are not enrolled at the preschool on the day of screening.
