          <p>A program of <strong><%= link_to 'Prevent Blindness Northern California', "http://www.eyeinfo.org" %></strong>, See Well to Learn was established in 2012 to ensure that preschoolers in underserved communities have equal access to comprehensive vision care and are ready for school. <strong><%= link_to 'Tipping Pont Community', "http://www.tippingpoint.org" %></strong> provided seed funding and management assistance to launch the Eye Bus program for Bay Area preschoolers. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          In 2013, See Well to Learn began its Screening Services program to reach children beyond underserved preschoolers and further its mission for all children to have the vision they need to succeed at school and in life.
